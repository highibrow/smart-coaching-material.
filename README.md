# Decentralized Coaching Materials

## Vision

The **Decentralized Coaching Materials** project aims to revolutionize the way educational resources are distributed and accessed. By leveraging Ethereum's blockchain technology and Solidity smart contracts, this project enables educational institutes to securely manage and distribute coaching materials directly to students. Our vision is to create a transparent, efficient, and inclusive system where students have easy access to quality educational content while ensuring content creators and institutions are fairly compensated.

## Flowchart

1. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the `CoachingMaterials` smart contract to the Ethereum network.

2. **Material Management**:
   - **Owner** adds materials via `addMaterial` function with details including IPFS hash, title, and price.

3. **Student Interaction**:
   - **Students** deposit Ether using `depositTokens`.
   - **Students** purchase access to materials via `purchaseAccess`.

4. **Access Control**:
   - **Students** can check their access status using `hasStudentAccess`.

5. **Funds Management**:
   - **Owner** can withdraw funds using `withdraw`.

## Future Scope

1. **Token Integration**: Implement ERC-20 tokens for transactions instead of Ether to enhance usability and scalability.
2. **Enhanced Security**: Integrate additional security features and audits to ensure robustness against potential vulnerabilities.
3. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web or mobile application to interact with the smart contract, making it easier for students and institutions to use the platform.
4. **Dynamic Pricing**: Introduce a system for dynamic pricing and discounts based on various factors like student achievements or subscription models.
5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement feedback and rating systems for materials to improve the quality and relevance of content.
